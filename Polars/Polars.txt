# Sure! Here are 15 challenging coding questions related to data manipulation using Polars for a DataFrame, along with their answers and use cases:

# 1. Filter rows where the 'age' column is greater than 30.
# Answer:
df_filtered = df.filter(df['age'] > 30)

# Use Case: Selecting only the rows with older employees.

# 2. Calculate the average value of the 'salary' column.
# Answer:
average_salary = df['salary'].mean()

# Use Case: Understanding the average salary across all employees.

# 3. Group by 'department' and calculate the maximum salary within each group.
# Answer:
max_salary_by_department = df.groupby('department')['salary'].max()

# Use Case: Identifying the highest salary in each department.

# 4. Create a new column 'bonus' which is 10% of the 'salary'.
# Answer:
df['bonus'] = df['salary'] * 0.10

# Use Case: Calculating employee bonuses based on their salary.

# 5. Replace missing values in the 'rating' column with the median value.
# Answer:
df['rating'].fillna(df['rating'].median(), inplace=True)

# Use Case: Handling missing data in the employee ratings.

# 6. Pivot the DataFrame to create a wide format with 'department' as columns and 'salary' as values.
# Answer:
pivoted_df = df.pivot(index='employee_id', columns='department', values='salary')

# Use Case: Creating a summary table with salaries by department.

# 7. Calculate the cumulative sum of the 'sales' column within each 'department'.
# Answer:
df['cumulative_sales'] = df.groupby('department')['sales'].cumsum()

# Use Case: Tracking the total sales over time for each department.

# 8. Merge two DataFrames based on a common column 'employee_id'.
# Answer:
merged_df = df1.merge(df2, on='employee_id', how='inner')

# Use Case: Combining employee data from different sources.

# 9. Calculate the difference between consecutive values in the 'revenue' column.
# Answer:
df['revenue_diff'] = df['revenue'].diff()

# Use Case: Analyzing changes in revenue over time.

# 10. Sort the DataFrame by multiple columns: 'department' (ascending) and 'salary' (descending).
# Answer:
sorted_df = df.sort_values(by=['department', 'salary'], ascending=[True, False])

# Use Case: Ordering employees by department and salary.

# 11. Create a new column 'rank' which assigns a rank to each row based on 'salary'.
# Answer:
df['rank'] = df['salary'].rank(ascending=False)

# Use Case: Ranking employees based on their salary.

# 12. Calculate the rolling average of the 'profit' column over a window of 3 rows.
# Answer:
df['rolling_avg_profit'] = df['profit'].rolling(window=3).mean()

# Use Case: Smoothing out profit fluctuations.

# 13. Remove duplicate rows based on columns 'employee_id' and 'department'.
# Answer:
df.drop_duplicates(subset=['employee_id', 'department'], inplace=True)

# Use Case: Ensuring unique employee records.

# 14. Create a new column 'quarter' based on the month in the 'date' column.
# Answer:
df['quarter'] = df['date'].dt.quarter

# Use Case: Aggregating data by quarters.

# 15. Apply a custom function to each value in the 'sales' column (e.g., log transformation).
# Answer:
df['log_sales'] = df['sales'].apply(lambda x: math.log(x))

# Use Case: Transforming sales data for analysis.
